       We use cad on the team in many different ways. One of those ways is through
       creating custom parts like our auto claw, to maximize the ability of our robot.
       We also use cad to design our schools theatre set and make awards for band.
       With these things we are able to help the extracurriculars. +


       Not only have we been able to implement cad into our orbot design for ustom parts.
       but weve also been able to implement cad into our fundrasing, outreaching into our
       theatre program and outreaching into our band program to host a fun awards night.
